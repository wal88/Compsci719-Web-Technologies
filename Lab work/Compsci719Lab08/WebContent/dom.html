		<p>The DOM models an HTML page as a tree structure.</p>

		<p>Every component of your HTML page is modelled as a <i>node</i> in the DOM tree.</p>

		<p>Warning: attributes are no longer going to inherit methods from Node in the DOM4 specification. Refer to <a href=
		"http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_attributes.asp">W3Schools The HTML DOM Attribute Object</a>. But that's in the future. At present attributes are still Nodes, even if calling Node methods on an attribute makes little sense.</p>

		<p>For each Node in the DOM tree, particularly nodes that are <i>elements</i>, you will want want to think about what node is its parent, whether it has any siblings, and any children.</p>

		<p>Knowing these relationships can let you navigate from one Node to another in an HTML page, starting at the document node.</p>

		<p>You'll be trying that in the next exercise. For this exercise, you will need to understand the interrelationships between the pieces of HTML content on this page: elements, text nodes, and anything else starting at the document level.</p>
		
		<p>Note how the tabbing on this page helps you to see relationships and the tree hierarchy better (when you view the source on this HTML page).</p>
