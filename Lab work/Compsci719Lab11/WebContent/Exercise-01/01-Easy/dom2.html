	<div class="text1">
		<p>The DOM models an HTML page as a tree structure.</p>

		<p>
			Every component of your HTML page is modelled as a <i>node</i> in the
			DOM tree.
		</p>

		<p>
			Warning: attributes are no longer going to inherit methods from Node
			in the DOM4 specification. Refer to <a
				href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_attributes.asp">W3Schools
				The HTML DOM Attribute Object</a>. But that's in the future. At present
			attributes are still Nodes, even if calling Node methods on an
			attribute makes little sense.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="text2">
		<p>
			For each Node in the DOM tree, particularly nodes that are <i>elements</i>,
			you will want want to think about what node is its parent, whether it
			has any siblings, and any children.
		</p>

		<p>Knowing these relationships can let you navigate from one Node
			to another in an HTML page, starting at the document node.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="text3">
		<p>You'll be trying that in the next exercise. For this exercise,
			you will need to understand the interrelationships between the pieces
			of HTML content on this page: elements, text nodes, and anything else
			starting at the document level.</p>

		<p>Note how the tabbing on this page helps you to see
			relationships and the tree hierarchy better (when you view the source
			on this HTML page).</p>
