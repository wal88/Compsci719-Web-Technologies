	<h2>Early life</h2>

	<p>One of 15 children, Ngata was born in Te Araroa (then called
		Kawakawa), a small coastal town about 175 kilometres north of
		Gisborne, New Zealand.[1] His iwi was Ng&#257;ti Porou. His father was
		Paratene Ngata, a tribal leader and expert in traditional lore, and
		his mother was Katerina Naki, the daughter of an itinerant Scot, Abel
		Knox.[2] Ngata was greatly influenced both by his father and by his
		great-uncle Ropata Wahawaha (who had led loyal kupapa Ng&#257;ti Porou
		forces against their Pai M&#257;rire enemy (commonly known as Hauhau)
		in the East Cape War and later Te Kooti's escapees from the Chatham
		Islands.)[3] Ngata was raised in a M&#257;ori environment, speaking
		the M&#257;ori language, but his father also ensured that Ngata
		learned about the P&#257;keh&#257; world, believing that this
		understanding would be of benefit to Ng&#257;ti Porou.</p>
	<p>
		Ngata attended primary school in Waiomatatini before moving on to Te
		Aute College, where he received a P&#257;keh&#257;-style education.
		Ngata performed well, and his academic results were enough to win him
		a scholarship to Canterbury University College (now the University of
		Canterbury), where he studied political science and law. He gained a
		BA in politics in 1893, the first M&#257;ori to complete a degree at a
		New Zealand university, then gained an LL.B. at the University of
		Auckland in 1896 (the first New Zealander, M&#257;ori or Pakeha, to
		gain a double degree).[4] <br />
	</p>

	<a id="sec2"></a>
	</a>
	<h2>Marriage</h2>

	<p>In 1895, a year before finishing his second degree (law), Ngata
		married 16-year-old Arihia Kane Tamati who was also of the Ng&#257;ti
		Porou iwi. Ngata had previously been engaged to Arihia's elder sister,
		Te Rina, but she died. Apirana and Arihia had eleven children; six
		girls and five boys.[1]</p>
	<p>
		Shortly after Ngata's legal qualifications were recognised, he and his
		wife returned to Waiomatatini where they built a house. Ngata quickly
		became prominent in the community, making a number of efforts to
		improve the social and economic conditions of M&#257;ori across the
		country. He also wrote extensively on the place of M&#257;ori culture
		in the modern age. At the same time, he gradually acquired a
		leadership role within Ng&#257;ti Porou, particularly in the area of
		land management and finance. <br />
	</p>

	<a id="sec3"></a>
	<h2>Political career</h2>

	<p>Ngata's first involvement with national politics came through
		his friendship with James Carroll, who was Minister of Native Affairs
		in the Liberal Party government. Ngata assisted Carroll in the
		preparation of two pieces of legislation, both of which were intended
		to increase the legal rights enjoyed by M&#257;ori. In the 1905
		election, Ngata himself stood as the Liberal candidate for the Eastern
		Maori electorate, challenging the incumbent Wi Pere. He was elected to
		Parliament.</p>

	<p>
		<br /> <br />Ngata quickly distinguished himself in Parliament as a
		skilled orator. He worked closely with his friend Carroll, and also
		worked closely with Robert Stout. Ngata and Stout, members of the
		Native Land Commission, were often critical of the government's
		policies towards M&#257;ori, particularly those designed at
		encouraging the sale of M&#257;ori land. In 1909, Ngata assisted John
		Salmond in the drafting of the Native Land Act.[citation needed]
	</p>
	<p>In late 1909, Ngata was appointed to Cabinet, holding a minor
		ministerial responsibility for M&#257;ori land councils. He retained
		this position until 1912, when the Liberal government was defeated.
		Ngata followed the Liberals into Opposition.[citation needed]</p>
	<p>In the First World War, Ngata was highly active in gathering
		M&#257;ori recruits for military service, working closely with Reform
		Party MP Maui Pomare. Ngata's own Ng&#257;ti Porou were particularly
		well represented among the volunteers. The M&#257;ori commitment to
		the war by some iwi, which became a mainly Cook Island commitment
		after 1942, can be attributed to Ngata and Pomare, created a certain
		amount of goodwill from P&#257;keh&#257; towards iwi who had loyally
		supported the country, and assisted Ngata's later attempts to resolve
		land grievances.</p>
	<p>Although in Opposition, Ngata enjoyed relatively good relations
		with his counterparts across the House in the Reform Party. He had a
		particularly good relationship with Gordon Coates, who became Prime
		Minister in 1925 and later "princess" Te Puea of Waikato. The
		establishment of several government bodies, such as the M&#257;ori
		Purposes Fund Control Board and the Board of M&#257;ori Ethnological
		Research, owed much to Ngata's involvement.</p>

	<a id="sec3b"></a>
	<h3>M&#257;ori interests</h3>

	<p>
		Ngata was also active in a huge variety of other endeavours. The most
		notable, perhaps, was his involvement in academic and literary circles
		– in this period, he published a number of works on significant
		M&#257;ori culture, with <span style="color: red;"><i>Nga
				moteatea</i></span>, a collection of M&#257;ori songs, being one of his better
		known works. Ngata was also heavily involved in the protection and
		advancement of M&#257;ori culture among M&#257;ori themselves, giving
		particular attention to promoting the haka, poi dancing, and
		traditional carving that had been begun by Te Puea. One aspect of his
		advocacy of M&#257;ori culture was the construction of many new
		traditional meeting houses throughout the country. Yet another of
		Ngata's interests was the promotion of M&#257;ori sport, which he
		fostered by encouraging intertribal competitions and tournaments.
		Finally, Ngata also promoted M&#257;ori issues within the Anglican
		Church in New Zealand, encouraging the creation of a M&#257;ori
		bishopric. In December 1928, Frederick Bennett, was consecrated as
		suffragan bishop to the Waiapu diocese with the title Bishop of
		Aotearoa.[5] Ngata and Bishop Herbert Williams campaigned for the
		recognition of M&#257;ori language as a subject for study in the
		University of New Zealand, with the study of M&#257;ori becoming
		eligible for a degree of bachelor of arts in 1928.[5]
	</p>
	<p>Throughout all this, Ngata also remained deeply involved in the
		affairs of his Ng&#257;ti Porou iwi, particularly as regards land
		development. He was instrumental in establishing the land
		incorporation scheme whereby unused M&#257;ori land with multiple
		owners were amalgamated under a farm manager—often Pakeha, who
		developed and ran the farm. In government he was able to arrange for
		the transfer of four blocks of farm land to Te Puea Herangi and her
		husband. He arranged grants and government loans to help her develop
		farms for Waikato. He fired the Pakeha farm manager and replaced him
		with Te Puea. He arranged a car for her so she could travel around her
		estates. In 1934, during the depression, the public, media and
		parliament became alarmed at the large sums of money being gifted to
		Te Puea and others. A royal commission was held and Ngata was found
		guilty of irregularities in expenditure and negligence in
		administration, but no major scandals were unearthed. His land
		projects up to 1934 had involved the expenditure of ₤500,000, most of
		which was recoverable. Ngata resigned in December 1934.[6] Ngata
		fought for higher living standards for the Maori people, and was very
		active during an economic depression in New Zealand in the Thirties,
		developing large farms which provided jobs and helped to restore the
		dignity of many Maori.[7]</p>
	<p>Ngata was knighted in 1927,[8] only the third M&#257;ori (after
		Carroll and Pomare) to receive this honour.</p>

	<a id="sec3c"></a>
	<h3>Ministerial career</h3>

	<p>In the 1928 elections, the United Party (a rebranding of the old
		Liberal Party, to which Ngata belonged) won an unexpected victory.
		Ngata was returned to Cabinet, becoming Minister of Native Affairs. He
		was ranked third within Cabinet, and occasionally served as acting
		Deputy Prime Minister. Ngata remained extremely diligent in his work,
		and was noted for his tirelessness. Much of his ministerial work
		related to land reforms, and the encouragement of M&#257;ori land
		development. Ngata continued to believe in the need to rejuvenate
		M&#257;ori society, and worked strongly towards this goal. In 1929,
		both Ngata's wife and eldest son died of illness.</p>
	<p>In 1932 Ngata and his Department of Native Affairs came under
		increasing criticism from other politicians. Many believed that Ngata
		was pressing ahead too fast, and the large amount of activity that
		Ngata ordered had caused organizational difficulties within the
		department. An inquiry into Ngata's department was held, and it was
		discovered that one of Ngata's subordinates had falsified accounts.
		Ngata himself was severely criticised for disregarding official
		regulations which he had often felt were inhibiting progress. It was
		also alleged that Ngata had shown favouritism to Ng&#257;ti Porou and
		Waikato, especially Te Puea and her husband. Robert Semple, the labour
		leader, said the investigation (by the royal commission) showed one of
		the worst specimens of abuse of political power, maladministration,
		misappropriation of public funds as well as a betrayal of trust.
		Ngata, while denying any personal wrongdoing, accepted responsibility
		for the actions of his department and was dismissed from his
		ministerial position.</p>
	<p>
		M&#257;ori leaders, such as Te Puea, were angry at Ngata for
		discrediting and embarrassing M&#257;ori.[9] <br />

			Ngata</a> Although Ngata had resigned from Cabinet, he still remained in
		Parliament. He was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal in
		1935.[10] In the 1935 elections, the Labour Party was triumphant –
		Ngata went into Opposition, although the new Labour government
		retained many of his land reform programs. Ngata remained in
		Parliament until the 1943 elections, when he was finally defeated by a
		Labour-Ratana candidate, Tiaki Omana. He stood again for his seat in
		the 1946 elections, but was unsuccessful.
	</p>
	<p>Despite leaving Parliament, Ngata remained involved in politics.
		He gave advice on M&#257;ori affairs to both Peter Fraser (a Labour
		Prime Minister) and Ernest Corbett (a National Minister of M&#257;ori
		Affairs), and arranged celebrations of the Treaty of Waitangi's
		centenary in 1940. In the Second World War, he once again helped
		gather M&#257;ori recruits. On 22 June 1950, he was appointed to
		Parliament's upper house, the Legislative Council, but was too ill by
		this time to take his seat.[11]</p>
	<p>Sir &#257;pirana and Lady Ngata guided the design of the St.
		Michael and All Angels’ Chapel at Hukarere Girls College, which chapel
		was consecrated on 1 November 1953.[12]</p>
	<p>Ngata died in Waiomatatini on 14 July 1950. He is remembered for
		his great contributions to M&#257;ori culture and language. His image
		appears on New Zealand's $50 note.</p>
	<p>
		Several schools have houses named after him, including Rangiora High
		School, Tauranga Boys' College, Rotorua Intermediate, Cashmere High
		School, Te Aute College (where Ngata went), Te Puke High School and
		Otumoetai Intermediate. <br />

	<h2>Family</h2>

	<p>On 19 October 2009, Apirana Ngata's last surviving daughter,
		Mate Huatahi Kaiwai (born Ngata), died at her residence at Ruatoria,
		East Cape, New Zealand, aged 94. She was interred next to her late
		husband Kaura-Ki-Te-Pakanga Kaiwai and her son Tanara Kaiwai at
		Pukearoha Urupa.</p>
	<p>Apirana Ngata's youngest son, Sir Henare Ngata (born 1918), died
		on 11 December 2011. He was M&#257;ori vice-president of the party
		1967-69 and stood as the National Party candidate for Eastern Maori in
		1969. [13] [14]</p>
	<p>Ngata's grandson Hōri Mahue Ngata wrote a widely used
		M&#257;ori-English dictionary.[citation needed]</p>
