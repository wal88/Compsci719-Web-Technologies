		  <h1 id="title-name">Edmund Hillary</h1>
		  <p><em>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</em>, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Hillary</p>
		  <p><strong>Sir Edmund Percival Hillary</strong> KG ONZ KBE (20 July 1919 – 11 January 2008) was a New Zealand mountaineer, explorer and philanthropist. On 29 May 1953, Hillary and Nepalese Sherpa mountaineer Tenzing Norgay became the first climbers to reach the summit of Mount Everest. They were part of the ninth British expedition to Everest, led by John Hunt. Hillary was named by Time as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century.</p>
		  <p>Hillary became interested in mountaineering while in secondary school, making his first major climb in 1939, reaching the summit of Mount Ollivier. He served in the Royal New Zealand Air Force as a navigator during World War II. Prior to the 1953 Everest expedition, Hillary had been part of the British reconnaissance expedition to the mountain in 1951, as well as an unsuccessful attempt to climb Cho Oyu in 1952. As part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition he reached the South Pole overland in 1958. He subsequently reached the North Pole, making him the first person to reach both poles and summit Everest.
		Following his ascent of Everest, Hillary devoted most of his life to helping the Sherpa people of Nepal through the Himalayan Trust, which he founded. Through his efforts, many schools and hospitals were built in Nepal.</p>

		  <h2>Youth</h2>
		  <p>Hillary was born to Percival Augustus Hillary and Gertrude Hillary, née Clark, in Auckland, Dominion of New Zealand, on 20 July 1919.[1] His family moved to Tuakau (south of Auckland) in 1920, after his father (who served at Gallipoli in the 15th North Auckland) was allocated land there.[2] His grandparents were early settlers in northern Wairoa in the mid-19th century after emigrating from Yorkshire, England.[3]</p>

		  <h2>Expeditions</h2>
		  <p>Harry Ayres, along with Mick Sullivan, led Hillary and Ruth Adams up the south ridge of Aoraki/Mount Cook, New Zealand's highest peak, on 30 January 1948.[11]
		  <p>Hillary was part of a British reconnaissance expedition to Everest in 1951 led by Eric Shipton before joining the successful British attempt of 1953.[citation needed]
		  <p>In 1952 Hillary and George Lowe were part of the British team led by Eric Shipton that attempted Cho Oyu.[12] After that attempt failed due to the lack of route from the Nepal side, Hillary and Lowe crossed the Nup La into Tibet and reached the old Camp II, on the northern side, where all the pre-war expeditions camped.[13]
		    
		    <h3>1953 Everest expedition</h3>
		  <p>The route to Everest was closed by Chinese-controlled Tibet, and Nepal only allowed one expedition per year. A Swiss expedition (in which Tenzing took part) had attempted to reach the summit in 1952 but was turned back by bad weather and exhaustion 800 feet (240 m) from the summit. During a 1952 trip in the Alps, Hillary discovered that he and his friend George Lowe had been invited by the Joint Himalayan Committee for the approved British 1953 attempt and immediately accepted.[14]</p>
		  <p>Shipton was named as leader but was replaced by Hunt. Hillary considered pulling out, but both Hunt and Shipton talked him into remaining. Hillary was intending to climb with Lowe but Hunt named two teams for the assault: Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans; and Hillary and Tenzing. Hillary therefore made a concerted effort to forge a working friendship with Tenzing.[14]</p>
		  <p>The Hunt expedition totalled over 400 people, including 362 porters, twenty Sherpa guides and 10,000 lbs of baggage,[15][16] and like many such expeditions, was a team effort. Lowe supervised the preparation of the Lhotse Face, a huge and steep ice face, for climbing. Hillary forged a route through the treacherous Khumbu Icefall.[14]</p>
		  <p>The expedition set up base camp in March 1953. Working slowly it set up its final camp at the South Col at 25,900 feet (7,890 m). On 26 May Bourdillon and Evans attempted the climb but turned back when Evans' oxygen system failed. The pair had reached the South Summit, coming within 300 vertical feet (91 m) of the summit.[16][17] Hunt then directed Hillary and Tenzing to go for the summit.[citation needed]</p>
		  <p>Snow and wind held the pair up at the South Col for two days. They set out on 28 May with a support trio of Lowe, Alfred Gregory and Ang Nyima. The two pitched a tent at 27,900 feet (8,500 m) on 28 May while their support group returned down the mountain. On the following morning Hillary discovered that his boots had frozen solid outside the tent. He spent two hours warming them before he and Tenzing attempted the final ascent wearing 30-pound (14 kg) packs.[14] The crucial move of the last part of the ascent was the 40-foot (12 m) rock face later named the "Hillary Step". Hillary saw a means to wedge his way up a crack in the face between the rock wall and the ice and Tenzing followed.[18] From there the following effort was relatively simple. Tenzing Norgay stated in his narration "The Dream Comes True" that Hillary had indeed taken the first step atop Mount Everest, despite Hillary quoting that both had reached the summit at the same time. They reached Everest's 29,028 ft (8,848 m) summit, the highest point on earth, at 11:30 am.[1][19] As Hillary put it, "A few more whacks of the ice axe in the firm snow, and we stood on top."[20]</p>
		  <p>They spent only about 15 minutes at the summit. Hillary took the famous photo of Tenzing posing with his ice-axe, but since Tenzing had never used a camera, Hillary's ascent went unrecorded.[21][22] However, according to Tenzing's autobiography Man of Everest, when Tenzing offered to take Hillary's photograph Hillary declined: "I motioned to Hillary that I would now take his picture. But for some reason he shook his head; he did not want it." Tenzing left chocolates in the snow as an offering and Hillary left a cross that he had been given by John Hunt.[14] Additional photos were taken looking down the mountain in order to confirm that they had made it to the top and that the ascent was not faked.[22]</p>
		  <p>The two had to take care on the descent after discovering that drifting snow had covered their tracks, complicating the task of retracing their steps. The first person they met was Lowe, who had climbed up to meet them with hot soup.</p>
		  <p><em>Well, George, we knocked the bastard off.<br />
		      &mdash;Edmund Hillary, first words to lifelong friend George Lowe on returning from Everest's summit[5][14]</em></p>
		  <p>News of the expedition reached Britain on the day of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, and the press called the successful ascent a coronation gift.[23] In return, the 37 members of the party received the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal with MOUNT EVEREST EXPEDITION engraved on the rim. The group was surprised by the international acclaim that they received upon arriving in Kathmandu.[14] Hillary and Hunt were knighted by the young queen,[24] while Tenzing received the George Medal from the British Government for his efforts with the expedition.[25][26][27]</p>

		  <h3>After Everest</h3>
		  <p>Hillary climbed ten other peaks in the Himalayas on further visits in 1956, 1960–1961, and 1963–1965. He also reached the South Pole as part of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, for which he led the New Zealand section, on 4 January 1958. His party was the first to reach the Pole overland since Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912, and the first ever to do so using motor vehicles.[citation needed]</p>
		  <p>Hillary narrowly missed becoming a victim in TWA Flight 266 from the American midwest in the 1960 New York air disaster, having been late for his flight.[28]</p>

		  <h2>Public recognition</h2>
		  <p>On 6 June 1953 Hillary was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire;[24] and on 6 February 1987 was the fourth appointee to the Order of New Zealand.[47] On 22 April 1995 Hillary was appointed Knight Companion of The Most Noble Order of the Garter.[48][49] The Government of India conferred on him its second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, posthumously, in 2008.[50] He was also awarded the Polar Medal for his part in the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition,[51] and the Order of Gorkha Dakshina Bahu, 1st Class of the Kingdom of Nepal in 1953.[52] His favoured New Zealand charity was the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre Inc. (OPC) of which he was Patron for 35 years. Hillary was particularly keen on the work this organisation did in introducing young New Zealanders to the outdoors in a very similar way to his first experience of a school trip to Mt Ruapehu at the age of 16. Various streets, schools and organisations around New Zealand and abroad are named after him. A few examples are Hillary College (Otara), Edmund Hillary Primary School (Papakura) and the Hillary Commission (now SPARC). Several schools have houses named after him, including Auckland Grammar School, Hutt International Boys' School, Macleans College, Rangiora High School, Tauranga Boys' College, Upper Hutt College, Sacred Heart RC Primary School, Hornsby House School, and Endeavour Primary School.[citation needed]</p>
		  <p>In 1992 Hillary appeared on the updated New Zealand $5 note, thus making him the only New Zealander to appear on a banknote during his or her lifetime, in defiance of the established convention for banknotes of using only depictions of deceased individuals, and current heads of state. The Reserve Bank governor at the time, Don Brash, had originally intended to use a deceased sportsperson on the $5 note but could not find a suitable candidate. Instead he broke with convention by requesting and receiving Hillary's permission — along with an insistence from Hillary to use Aoraki/Mount Cook rather than Mount Everest in the backdrop. The image also features a Ferguson TE20 tractor like the one Hillary used to reach the South Pole on the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition. A 2.3-metre (7.5 ft) bronze statue of "Sir Ed" was installed outside The Hermitage hotel at Mount Cook Village, New Zealand, in 2003.[citation needed]</p>
		<p>In June 2004 Hillary was awarded Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland.[54]</p>
		  <p>To mark the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first successful ascent of Everest the Nepalese government conferred honorary citizenship upon Hillary at a special Golden Jubilee celebration in Kathmandu, Nepal. He was the first foreign national to receive that honour.[55]</p>
		  <p>In 2008, the same year he died, the Indian Government conferred him with Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honour of the country.[56]</p>
		  <p>In 2005 a poll conducted by Reader's Digest put Hillary as "New Zealand's most trusted individual", beating cyclist Sarah Ulmer and film director Peter Jackson.[57] He kept the title in 2006 and 2007[58] After his death in 2008 he was succeeded by Willie Apiata VC, a Corporal in the NZSAS.[59]</p>
		  <p>Two Antarctic features are named after Hillary. The <em>Hillary Coast</em> is a section of coastline south of Ross Island and north of the Shackleton Coast. It is formally recognised by New Zealand, the United States of America and Russia. The <em>Hillary Canyon</em>, an undersea feature in the Ross Sea appears on the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans, which is published by the International Hydrographic Organization.[60]</p>
		  <p>In 1974, Folkways Records released Interview with <em>Sir Edmund Hillary: Mountain Climbing</em> which included his thoughts on the Everest Expedition and the Abominable Snowman.[citation needed]</p>
